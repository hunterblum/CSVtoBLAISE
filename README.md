#### Description 
This RShiny Application was developed as part of my work with the National Agricultural Statistics Service. It processes our "holds" surveys into our editing software, Blaise. A survey hold is typically an important producer that we will manually contact and enter their survey data into an Excel or CSV file. This app automates the process of turning that CSV file into the specific .RAW format that Blaise requires. You can try out the app by uploading the "ExampleTemplate.csv" into the app and downloading, or by entering your own data following the app instructions.
